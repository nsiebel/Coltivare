    <h1>Products </h1>
    <p>Here at Coltivare we are openning a new window in helping farmers grow and raise their crops and livestock. We plan that our well engineered products are going to change the way of agriculture and make it better and easier for decision making.
    </p>
    <p>At Coltivare, our two <strong>main</strong> products include our drone system along with our software that we call <em>Coltiview</em>. If you feel that your farming area doesn't require a drone and is on the smaller side, here at Coltivare we also offer a camera system in substitute to our drone system. Whether you buy the drone system or the camera system, they are complements to the <em>Coltiview</em> software and are highly recommended to be purchased together so we can ensure you get the best feedback full experience we have to offer. 
    </p>
    <h1>Coltiview</h1>
    <p>Our software system <em>Coltiview</em> provides our users with all kinds of feedback for both crops and livestock. When the images are uploaded to the software from the drone/camera, we give feedback on damaged areas or areas that are starting to crow in faster and are closer to being harvested compared to other crops on the farm. From a livestock standpoint, we give feedback if one of your animals is sick or possibly pregnant.
    </p>
    <h1>How it Works</h1>
    <p>Even though our products consist of highly sophisticated engineering and technology, products from Coltivare are very simple to use.
    </p>
